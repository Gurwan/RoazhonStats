# RoazhonStats
Web application built with the PHP framework: Symfony. <br>
The data are retrieved on the Sofascore site (age,photo,weight. . . ) and the statistical data will be retrieved on Wikipedia (the APIs are not free and other sites put limits on the requests). <br> ReactJS will be used later in the project.
